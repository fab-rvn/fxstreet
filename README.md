## Overview

The app is a dashboard page that fetch posts from an internal api and display
the content. The user can navigate between the latest and popular posts. The
articles are order by date of publication and they includes all the information
about the author: like name, company name and profile image and the post
information: like feed, subfeeds, date of publication, title, and content. At
the bottom of each post there are three action button to like a post, save it or
open a dialog menu that show more actions.

The app is fully-responsive, in mobile version I change a little bit the design,
like the sidebar that became responsive with open close toggle menu. I also
replaced the placeholder bars for some fake content just to have some content to
fill the space.

I use redux to fetch the post and handle the state for all the app, so if this
project grown the main structure is already set.
